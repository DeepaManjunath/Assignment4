Received the following  mail from admin. I have done annotations in sanchitcljain@gmail.com account.


Hi, 

We are sorry for that. 

Your email address (probably you registered late, and the logins we created missed your email) is not registered for the online tool. 

To save time can you use sanchitcljain@gmail.com for email and password. We will take these annotations for your account. Else we'd need to wait till tomorrow for developer to create an account for you. 

Hoping this works for you. Regards
